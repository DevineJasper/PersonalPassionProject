# PersonalPassionProject

Project last year Digital Design &amp; Development (DEVINE) @ Howest Kortrijk

## IDEA 1 - KARAOKE

A website where you can sing songs alone or together with friends.

- php (account, songs, scores), html, js
- ml5 pitchdetection
- socket.io (multiplayer)
- Tone.js

--> No react.js, because ml5 and react don't mix.

## IDEA 2 - RUNNER ROUTE CALCULATOR

A webapplication (mobile first), that calculates a running route for you.
You cans decide the sart and end point + how many KM's you want to run,
the application gives you some suggested routes.

--> research in progress
